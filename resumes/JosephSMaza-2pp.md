## Professional Experience
### Tableau Software / Salesforce – Seattle, WA
**Software Engineer - Build/Release, Dependency Upgrades & Security Remediation | August 2018 - July 2023**
(Initially contracted via Insight Global; hired full-time in February 2019)
- Delivered comprehensive dependency upgrades across all core production systems, addressing a backlog of recurring security CVEs spanning more than five years. Reduced critical vulnerabilities by an estimated 80%, limiting new CVEs to just 3–4 annually.
- Managed back-porting of critical CVE patches to older releases per SLA requirements, maintaining support across releases spanning two years back; coordinated validation and rollout timing to minimize customer impact.
- Scoped and estimated third-party upgrade efforts by analyzing version deltas, breaking changes, and validation requirements to plan timelines and sequencing.
- Completed two major OpenSSL upgrades, managing API/ABI breaking changes and ensuring compatibility for downstream consumers.
- Collaborated with security and platform teams to prioritize CVE remediation, plan rollouts, and reduce compatibility risks.
- Diagnosed C/C++ and build failures, including compiler/linker errors and toolchain/environment discrepancies.
- Monitored pre-integration/private builds for dependency upgrades, identifying and addressing build breaks before merging into mainline CI.
- Developed automation scripts to eliminate manual steps in the update process, transforming error-prone procedures into reliable automated workflows.
- Coordinated validation and sign-off with domain specialists (QA, platform, security, and owning teams) based on the affected area for each upgrade.
- Authored release documentation and operational runbooks covering dependency updates.

### Microsoft (via HCL/Flexasoft, VMC Consulting, Volt) - Redmond, WA
**Build Engineer / SDET | August 2000 - October 2017**
- Maintained and monitored builds for Windows, Office, and Xbox-aligned teams, triaging C#/C/C++ compile/link failures across multiple code bases.
- Created PowerShell automation to streamline branching and build operations, reducing a two-hour manual process to approximately 15 minutes.
- Identified the change responsible for a build break; coordinated a revert when needed and supported developers with debugging and fix suggestions.
- Wrote PowerShell scripts to automate build-related housekeeping tasks and reduce manual overhead for the team.
- Coordinated with developers and release stakeholders on go/no-go decisions, hotfix verification, and build readiness across branches.
